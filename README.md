# Horiseon Homepage Refactor Project

This project is a refactor of the homepage for the digital marketing firm Horiseon. The learning objectives targeted by this project are:
* Using semantic HTML elements
* Using logical structure for CSS styling
* Using the accessible alt attributes
* Using headings in sequential order
* Creating a concise descriptive title
* Cloning, creating, and pushing to Git repositories 

## Where to Find It
The deployed website can be found [here](https://pikaypi.github.io/Horiseon-Homepage/).

## What It Looks Like

## How it works
The links in the navigation bar redirect to each paragraph with the associated information about Horiseon. Next to these paragraphs is an info bar with benefits of working with Horiseon. The footer provides information about the original creation of the website.
